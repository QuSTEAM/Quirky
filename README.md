# The Quirky Quantum Simulator <img src="doc/favicon.ico" alt="Icon" title="Icon" />

Quirky is a fork of Quirk, the toy quantum circuit simulator from **[algassert.com/quirk](http://algassert.com/quirk)**, and very much work in progress.

We are simplifying Quirk in the context of developing a quantum computing course for high-school students.
