# The Quirky Quantum Simulator <img src="doc/favicon.ico" alt="Icon" title="Icon" />

Quirky is a fork of **[Quirk](http://algassert.com/quirk)**, the drag & drop quantum circuit simulator by Craig Gidney.

We have been simplifying Quirk in the context of developing a quantum computing course for high-school students; see **[quantum-quest.nl](https://www.quantum-quest.nl)** for details.


# How to Build Quirky

```bash
npm install
npm run build -- --profile="Quest 1"
# npm run build-debug -- --profile="Quest 1"
```

Confirm the build succeeded by opening `out/QuirkyQuest1.html` with a web browser.
